Let \(\mathbb{Z}\) be the set of integers. Determine all functions \(f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\) such that, for all integers \(a\) and \(b\),
\[ f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a+b)). \]

Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's try to find some properties of \(f\) by plugging in specific values.
   - Let \(a = 0, b = x\): \(f(0) + 2f(x) = f(f(x))\)
   - Let \(a = x, b = 0\): \(f(2x) + 2f(0) = f(f(x))\)

2. Comparing these equations, we can see that \(f(2x) + f(0) = 2f(x)\)

3. Plugging it into our equation, \(2f(a)-f(0)+2f(b)=2f(a+b)+f(0) \implies f(a)+f(b)=f(a+b)+f(0)\) which is Cauchy equation, and hence \(f(x) = kx + c\) for some values of k and c.

4. For this to hold for all \(a\) and \(b\), we must have:
   - \(2k = k^2\) (coefficient of \(a\))
   - \(2k = k^2\) (coefficient of \(b\))
   - \(3c = kc + c\) (constant terms)

5. From \(2k = k^2\), we get \(k = 0\) or \(k = 2\).
   - If \(k = 0\), then \(f(x) = c\) is a constant function
   - If \(k = 2\), then from \(3c = 2c + c\), any \(c\) works

6. Therefore, the solutions are:
   - \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\)
   - \(f(x) = 2x + c\) for any integer \(c\)

7. We can verify these solutions work in the original equation.

Therefore, all solutions are the zero function and the functions of the form \(f(x) = 2x + c\) for any integer \(c\).
