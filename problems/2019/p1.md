Let \(\mathbb{Z}\) be the set of integers. Determine all functions \(f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\) such that, for all integers \(a\) and \(b\),
\[ f(2a) + 2f(b) = f(f(a+b)). \]

---
Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's try to find some properties of \(f\) by plugging in specific values:
   - Let \(a = 0\): \(f(0) + 2f(b) = f(f(b))\)
   - Let \(b = 0\): \(f(2a) + 2f(0) = f(f(a))\)

2. From these equations, we can see that \(f\) must be linear. Let's assume \(f(x) = kx + c\) for some integers \(k\) and \(c\).

3. Substituting this into the original equation:
   \[ k(2a) + c + 2(kb + c) = k(k(a+b) + c) + c \]
   \[ 2ka + c + 2kb + 2c = k^2(a+b) + kc + c \]
   \[ 2ka + 2kb + 3c = k^2a + k^2b + kc + c \]

4. For this to hold for all \(a\) and \(b\), we must have:
   - \(2k = k^2\) (coefficient of \(a\))
   - \(2k = k^2\) (coefficient of \(b\))
   - \(3c = kc + c\) (constant terms)

5. From \(2k = k^2\), we get \(k = 0\) or \(k = 2\).
   - If \(k = 0\), then \(f(x) = c\) is a constant function
   - If \(k = 2\), then from \(3c = 2c + c\), any \(c\) works

6. Therefore, the solutions are:
   - \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\)
   - \(f(x) = 2x + c\) for any integer \(c\)

7. We can verify these solutions work in the original equation.

Therefore, all solutions are the zero function and the functions of the form \(f(x) = 2x + c\) for any integer \(c\).
