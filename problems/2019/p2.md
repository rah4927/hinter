In triangle \(ABC\), point \(A_1\) lies on side \(BC\) and point \(B_1\) lies on side \(AC\). Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be points on segments \(AA_1\) and \(BB_1\), respectively, such that \(PQ\) is parallel to \(AB\). Let \(P_1\) be a point on line \(PB_1\), such that \(B_1\) lies strictly between \(P\) and \(P_1\), and \(\angle PP_1C = \angle BAC\). Similarly, let \(Q_1\) be the point on line \(QA_1\), such that \(A_1\) lies strictly between \(Q\) and \(Q_1\), and \(\angle CQ_1Q = \angle CBA\).

Prove that points \(P\), \(Q\), \(P_1\), and \(Q_1\) are concyclic.
